## YaHT-TurtleWoW
Yet Another Hunter Timer for Turtle WoW, forked from the 1.12 branch of https://github.com/Aviana/YaHT. I take no credit for the original addon.

- Auto Shot timer aware of Aimed Shot, Multi-Shot, and Trueshot
- Tranq Shot announcements aware of failures (misses)
- Adds Aimed Shot, Multi-Shot, and Trueshot to the cast bar (tested with OCB and stock)

By defaults set in YaHT.lua, all of these features are turned on.

### Installation
- Extract the contents. Do not simply place the YaHT-TurtleWoW-master folder in your Addons folder.
- Place the YaHT folder in your Addons folder
- Place YaHT.lua in WTF\Account\YOURACCOUNTNAME\SavedVariables


### Notes
This addon is provided "as is" and doesn't entitle you to any support.
